Code samples for http://www.slagheap.info/2015/10/setting-atmatrix-values-in-python.html

To render the bouncing cube sequence, just do this:

python atmatrix_demo.py

You can turn down the samples in cube_bounce.ass to get faster, lower-quality 
images (of course). Tested with 2.7. No idea about Python 3.

If you just want to get to work, there's an MIT license on that guy,
so grab the functions and move on.

I also included the little script I wrote to export transforms from 
Maya, generate.py. Of course my copy of Maya is ancient (Maya 2009) so 
it's probably useless but who knows.
