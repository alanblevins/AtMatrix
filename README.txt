To render the bouncing cube sequence, just do this:

python atmatrix_demo.py

You can turn down the samples in cube_bounce.ass to get faster, lower-quality 
images (of course). Tested with 2.7. No idea about Python 3.

I also included the little script I wrote to export transforms from 
Maya, generate.py. Of course my copy of Maya in ancient (Maya 2009) so 
it's probably useless but who knows.
